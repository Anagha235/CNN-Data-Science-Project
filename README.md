# CNN-Data-Science-Project
Optimizing Smart Recycling system Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This study compares several deep learning models and a hybrid combination for multi-class waste categorization using the RealWaste dataset. The goal is to assess model effectiveness in real-world garbage sorting systems, particularly in recycling and sustainability applications.

Six models were tested:

Baseline CNN

Hyperparameter-tuned CNN

Baseline CNN plus SVM

Tuned CNN plus SVM

EfficientNetB0

Tuned Efficient NetB0

Dataset: The RealWaste dataset

Dataset License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Classes: Cardboard, Food Organics, Glass, Metal, Miscellaneous Trash, Paper, Plastic, Vegetation (The Textile Trash was removed due to low representation)
